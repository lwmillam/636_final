  For my practicum I partnered with the Paradise, CA branch of the Butte County Library System.  Due to the situation with Covid-19, Paradise Library is having to maintain limited hours and services and was very interested in creating programming that patrons could access from home.  Under the supervision of the local staff, I created a website that provided a study guide, multimedia tutorials, and a scheduling setup that allows patrons to create 3D objects and which they can have printed at the library using our 3D printer.  The website can be found  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/paradisemakerspace/home">here</a> .

<h2>The creation of the Paradise Trial Makerspace required me to...</h2>
<p>communicate both verbally and in writing in a professional manner with the library colleagues that I was collaborating with.  Thanks to Covid-19 and performing my duties at a distance, a very large proportion of my time discussing with other library staff has been through email.  Maintaining both a professional and convivial tone can be a more difficult line to walk in the written word that lacks non-verbal cues, but I feel that I was able to do so.  I also cooperated in drafting the emails sent to local schools to attract student participation.</p>

<h2>In creating complex programming from scratch, I had to demonstrate...</h2>
<p>the ability to both conceptualize an entire system from a high level as well as break the entire project down into segments and sub-segments and approach the creation of each piece in a systematic fashion.  I had to create a system that I could make function for the duration of the project, but also consider the potentiality that the library might want to keep anything I created long-term.  Keeping that in mind, I had to keep an eye on what might happen with the space after I was gone and develop the makerspace's tools in such a way that anybody could step into my role with minimal training.  In developing these systems I had to rely on input from colleagues at the library as well as professors.  Their input was always useful in some way.  In some cases the feedback was frank and somewhat harsh.  It was important to my success that I was able to hear, process, and incorporate feedback that I might not have been excited to hear.</p>

<h2>Creating programming for this makerspace was...</h2>
<p>challenging because I had to design programming for a patron base I have never interacted with.  I had only lived in Paradise, California for a couple of weeks before starting this project.  I have experience as a teacher working with youths roughly in this age group with varying levels of English proficiency, and I had to draw upon that experience a great deal.  In talking with the local library staff I was able form a general idea of my audience, and combined with my experience I was able to design instruction that met a large percentage of needs.  By combining written materials with other a/v sources as well as creating tutorial videos for the operation aspects of the makerspace, I believe I have created a space that patrons can explore at their own level and pace.  The video tutorials in particular I created to help cover gaps between the study materials and a finished design. </p>

<h2>To paraphrase Moltke the Elder... </h2>
<p>no programming survives contact with patrons.  As good as I feel about the quality of programming I was able to create, invariably I will have missed something.  There's only one of me, and there are many patrons.  Each person interacting with my programming will have a different way of viewing and understanding things which could potentially show them gaps that I missed.  This is why I created a post-process survey for patrons that actively solicits feedback and criticism to help me fix any of the problems I missed.  Additionally, the program's email is prominently displayed on the front page and at the start and end of every video tutorial.  If there are any issues that need to be quickly addressed patrons have the ability to communicate them more quickly than the survey provides for.</p>

<h2>I chose to create a makerspace because...</h2>
<p>it is one of the current technology trends in libraries that fascinates me.  I believe that if libraries are going to remain relevant they have to be about more than just books in the public's mind.  Things like 3D printers and CAD tools are information generators that the public should be familiar with.  They are also very complex and expensive, which puts them out of the reach of a large portion of the population.  Libraries have access to resources and expertise that can help guide people to an understanding of information technologies and what those tools can do in their lives.  It was important to me that I ensure that whatever tools were in the makerspace were as equitably accessible as possible, and so I chose tools that were open source and platform agnostic as possible.  The goal was to put people on all income levels, experience levels, and computer availability levels on as equal a footing as I could.  </p>

<h2>Creating programming as complex as a makerspace requires...</h2>
<p>a great deal of planning. There are too many parts to shoot from the hip and have things turn out well. I created a map of what I wanted, then attacked each section systematically until I had what I and my patrons need from the space. Not relying on just my own judgement, I sought assessment from my site supervisor, his supervisor, and multiple library faculty at UNCG in order to ensure my design and work lived up to my standards, the standards of the library, and the standards of the community. </p>

<h2>I had to really focus on the details when...</h2>
<p> creating and curating the content for the study guide and video tutorials.  The study guide in particular was difficult to curate because I wanted to use as much of the collection as possible while still maintaining within an appropriate skill and literacy range for my target audience.  There were several books the library had on hand that provided a great deal of information, but were so technical as to be highly inaccessible to most of my audience.  I also strove to summarize each item in simple language to help patrons figure out what they needed without getting overwhelmed.  Knowing that certain content types were more likely to draw the eye differently than others, I arranged each element that would be simple to navigate and would draw the eye across the entire collection.  A lot of the technology that the makerspace uses is likely to be new to most users, and many potential users might not speak English as their primary language.  Since I am not able to produce content in any other languages and I wouldn't be on site to offer aid directly, I endeavored to use highlighted visuals during the tutorial videos to make things as easy to follow along as possible.  The video format is great for this kind of tool because videos can be paused, rewound, and re-watched as often as patrons find necessary in order to understand and complete the task.  In producing all of this information, my goal was to create a system that would allow patrons to not only easily access information, but also to aid them in creating their own.
