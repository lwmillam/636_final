<h1> Lance Millam's Work History</h1>
<body>
  <h2> My path to librarianship has been unconventional...</h2>
  <p> but it has given me an effective set of bedrock skills.  I have worked with people from many different cultures, languages and language fluencies, and academic backgrounds.  I have completed simple and complex tasks independently and as part of a team efficently, effectively, and in a timely fashion.  I have worked in all types of conditions doing a wide variety of tasks.  My references can attest to my positive attitude, my excellent work ethic, and my unbeatable desire to learn more and do better.
  </p>
  <p>My ventures in the US and abroad working in education and in blue collar fields has taught me a great deal about experiences and perspectives other than my own.  Now more than ever we need to value and support one another no matter our bacground, and I believe my work history has placed me in a wonderful postion to empathize, value, and collaborate with others no matter who they are.
